This project dives into airport traffic data from the world's busiest airports. The data is collected from Wikipedia on a page titled, "List of busiest airports by passenger traffic." This dataset provides valuable information about which airports are the busiest, along with which airports are growing the fastest. It will provide a great opportunity to visualize global trends and identify the regions that are growing the fastest in air travel.
